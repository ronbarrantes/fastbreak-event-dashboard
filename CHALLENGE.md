# Fastbreak Event Dashboard

## Challenge Description:

Build a full-stack Sports Event Management application where users can create, view, and manage sports events with venue information.

## Technical Requirements:

- **Framework:** Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** Supabase
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Email and/or Google SSO)

## Core Requirements

### Authentication

- Sign up / Login with email & password or Google OAuth Sign-in
- Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)
- Logout functionality

### Dashboard

- When users login, they should be taken to a home page / dashboard that:
  - Display list of all sports events
    - Show key event details: name, date, venue, sport type
  - Navigate to create/edit event forms
  - Responsive grid/list layout
  - Search by name, filter by sport - should refetch from the database

### Event Management

- User should be able to create events:
  - Event name
  - Sport type (e.g., Soccer, Basketball, Tennis)
  - Date & Time
  - Description
  - Venues (Plural)
- User should be able to edit events
- User should be able to delete events

## Additional Information

- All database interactions MUST happen server-side

  - Server Actions
  - API Routes (Route Handlers)
  - Server Components

- NO direct Supabase client calls from client components
- Actions over API Routes. At Fastbreak, we’re pushing towards using only actions, instead of API routes.

  - Create generic helper(s) to ensure type safety in the application and consistent error handling.

- Use shadcn/ui components throughout

- Forms MUST use [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form). Form component with react-hook-form
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for success/error states

## Submission

- Deployed to Vercel (or other hosting platform) with a working public URL
- Code submitted via GitHub repository

## Time Expectation:

- 2-3 hours
